NAME
    Finance::Wesabe - Access your wesabe.com account information

SYNOPSIS
        my $w = Finance::Wesabe->new( {
            username => $u,
            password => $p,
        } );
    
        printf "%s: %s\n", $_->name, $_->pretty_balance for $w->accounts;

DESCRIPTION
        Wesabe is part money management tool, part community.

    This module provides access to your basic account info via the wesabe
    API. It currently supports a subset of the 1.0.0 API.

WESABE.COM SHUTDOWN / OPEN SOURCE "MESABE"
    On July 31st, 2010, the wesabe.com service shut its doors. Subsequently,
    parts of the application have been released as open source code on the
    wesabe github account (<http://www.github.com/wesabe>).

    Of particular interest are the instructions to get a local copy of the
    wesabe web app running locally (known as "mesabe"):
    <http://github.com/wesabe/mesabe/wiki>.

    At the time of this writing, it is unclear if this module will interface
    with a locally run version of the app, however, the base URL is
    configurable as follows:

        my $w = Finance::Wesabe->new( {
            url      => 'http://localhost:3000/', # change as required
            username => $u,
            password => $p,
        } );

ACCESSORS
    *   agent - A useragent for all requests

    *   url - Base URI for all requests

    *   username - your wesabe.com username

    *   password - your wesabe.com password

METHODS
  accounts( )
    Returns Finance::Wesabe::Account objects for each of your accounts.

  account( $index )
    Returns a Finance::Wesabe::Account object for the given <$index>.

    NB: Accounts have no specific numeric id, so 1 means the first account,
    and so on.

    Returns a Finance::Wesabe::Profile with your profile information.
